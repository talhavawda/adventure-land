## Execution Instructions
- Download the AdventureLand folder
- Run the AdventureLand.exe file
- The security of MS Access AdventureLand.mdb database has been removed so that you may access login details of Admin and Employee staff to test the application. 
- Since a ticket has only same-day validity, the Visitor login window only shows the ticket numbers that were issued on the current day.
